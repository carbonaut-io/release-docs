# @carbounaut/release-docs

[**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) shareable configuration to publish Angular and Ionic GitHub projects and to deploy the `changelog` file as a JSON or HTML format to an external GitHub project.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev semantic-release@17 @carbonaut/release-docs
```

## Usage

### Project Setup

When installing this package for the first time, the following shareable configuration (`.releaserc.json`) is automatically added to your project root folder:

```json
{
  "extends": "@carbonaut/release-docs"
}
```

Add the following `semantic-release` command into the scripts section on your `package.json`:

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "semantic-release": "semantic-release"
  }
...
```

### Environment Variables Configuration

Ensure that your CI configuration has the following environment variables set:

- **GH_TOKEN**: A GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token);

- **RELEASE_DOCS_PROJECT_ID**: Unique project identifier. It will be used as the changelog file title on the S3 bucket;

- **RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: [AWS access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html) from the S3 bucket where the changelog file will be hosted; 

- **RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: [AWS secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html) from the S3 bucket where the changelog file will be hosted.

### Triggering a Releasing Locally

```bash
$ RELEASE_DOCS_PROJECT_ID=<project ID> RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key> RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS secret access key> RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_BUCKET=<AWS bucket> GH_TOKEN=<GitHub token> npm run semantic-release --dry-run=false --no-ci
```

### Automation With CI

First, setup all the required [environment variables](#Configuration) on your CI environment. Then just call the following script on your CI configuration file to trigger the release process:

```bash
$ npm run semantic-release
```

### Scripts

The following scripts are also available to be used separately.

#### release-docs-adjust-version

Update the package version to the next release version on the following files:
 - package.json: property version (this file is required)
 - config.xml: attribute version (this file is optional)

```bash
release-docs-adjust-version --version=<version>
```

#### release-docs-changelog-upload-s3

Upload the new generated CHANGELOG to a S3 bucket:

1. Convert the CHANGELOG.md file to JSON format;
2. Send the parsed changelog content to the S3 bucket `RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_BUCKET`. This file will be available at _https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/<RELEASE_DOCS_AWS_BUCKET>/<RELEASE_DOCS_PROJECT_ID>.json_.
  
```bash
release-docs-changelog-upload-s3 --key=<ṕroject ID> --awsAccessKeyId=<AWS access key> --awsSecretAccessKey<AWS secret access key> --awsBucket=<AWS bucket>"
```
