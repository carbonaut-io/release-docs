# @carbounaut/release-docs

[**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) shareable configuration to publish Angular and Ionic GitHub projects and to deploy the `changelog` file as a JSON to an external GitHub project.

## Plugins

This shareable configuration uses the following plugins:
- [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
- [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
- [`@semantic-release/changelog`](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog)
- [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github)
- [`@semantic-release/exec`](https://github.com/semantic-release/exec)
- [`@semantic-release/git`](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)

## Summary

This shareable configuration performs the following actions:

1. Analyze commits ([`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyze))
2. Generate changelog content ([`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator))
3. Create or update a changelog file generated by **step 2** ([`@semantic-release/changelog`](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog))
4. Update the package version to the next release version ([release-docs-adjust-version](#release-docs-adjust-version))
5. Commit release assets to the project's git repository with the commit message `chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci] ${nextRelease.notes}`. The following files are committed:
    - `package-lock.json`
    - `package.json`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`
    - `config.xml`
6. Publish a GitHub release and comment on released Pull Requests/Issues ([`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github))
7. Update the external GitHub project with the new generated CHANGELOG ([release-docs-update-changelog-project](#release-docs-update-changelog-project))

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev semantic-release @carbonaut/release-docs
```

## Usage

When installing this package for the first time, the following shareable configuration (`.releaserc.json`) is automatically added to your project root folder:

```json
{
  "extends": "@carbonaut/release-docs"
}
```

### Configuration

Ensure that your CI configuration has the following environment variables set:

- **GH_TOKEN**: [GitHub personal access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) token to access the external changelog project

- **CHANGELOG_PROJECT_REPO_URL**: GitHub project URL which maintains the external changelog project. E.g.: `https://github.com/<owner>/<project>` 

- **CHANGELOG_PROJECT_FILE**: File path to save the changelog on external project. E.g.: `assets/files/my-project.html`

### Trigger a release locally

```bash
$ CHANGELOG_PROJECT_REPO_URL=<GitHub project URL> CHANGELOG_PROJECT_FILE=<GitHub file path> GH_TOKEN=<GitHub token> semantic-release --dry-run=false --no-ci
```

### Automation with CI

First, setup all the required [environment variables](#Configuration) on your CI environment. Then just add the following script to your CI configuration file:

```bash
$ semantic-release
```

### Scripts

The following scripts are also available to be used separately.

#### release-docs-adjust-version

Update the package version to the next release version on the following files:
 - package.json: property version (this file is required)
 - config.xml: attribute version (this file is optional)

```bash
release-docs-adjust-version --version=<version>
```

#### release-docs-update-changelog-project

Update the external GitHub project with the new generated CHANGELOG:
  - Convert the CHANGELOG.md file to JSON format
  - Send the JSON changelog version to the external project set on `$CHANGELOG_PROJECT_REPO_URL` to the file path `$CHANGELOG_PROJECT_FILE`.

```bash
release-docs-update-changelog-project --repo_url=<repo URL> --token=<token> --file_path=<file path>
```
